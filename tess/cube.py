# cube consists of two lists: corners and edges
# all cubies are identified by a number
# corner positions are indicated by the position of the cubie in the list
# corner rotations are:
#  - 0 if up or down sticker in up or down face
#  - 1 if up or down sticker left with up or down face up
#  - 2 if up or down sticker right with up or down face up
# edge positions are indicated by the position of the cubie in the list
# edge rotations are:
#  - True if sticker adjacent to own or opposite center
#  - False if sticker not adjacent to own or opposite center

# corners: order, position, rotation:
# "ufl", "ufr", "ubr", "ubl", "dfl", "dfr", "dbr", "dbl"
#   0      1      2      3      4      5      6      7
#   0      0      0      0      0      0      0      0
# edges: order, position, rotation:
# "ul", "ur", "dr", "dl", "uf", "ub", "db", "df", "fl", "fr", "br", "bl"

# cube input:
# - All the stickers on the cube have a color and those colours are represented by the first
#   letter of that color. "red" becomes r, "blue" is b, "green" is g, "yellow" is y, "white" is w
#   and "orange" is o.
# - Choose a face to solve to: for instance, if white has already partially been solved,
#   take white as top face. Then type the letter of that color, followed by the letter of the
#   front face and the letter of the left face, followed by a whitespace.
# - Start with the top face by typing the letters representing the colors. Type in a circle,
#   starting with the top left corner (which is adjacent to the back and left face) and going
#   clockwise. All letters must be typed without whitespaces in between. End with a whitespace to
#   distinguish this face from other faces to come. The middle sticker isn't needed, so you
#   should now have three characters, a whitespace, eight characters and then another whitespace.
# - The next face is the bottom face. Again start with the top left corner (adjacent to the front
#   and left face) and continue clockwise). Again don't use whitespaces until the end.
# - Now do the front and back faces (in that order) starting with the top left corners adjacent
#   to top and left faces and top and right faces, respectively. Circle clockwise and use
#   whitespaces to distinguish the faces.
# - Finally, input the left and right faces (again in order) starting with the top left corners
#   adjacent to the top and back faces and the top and front faces, respectively. Use a
#   whitespace to distinguish the two faces from each other but since no further input is needed,
#   don't type a whitespace at the end.
